This project is a simple HTML page detailing a recipe.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated how to:

- Set up a GitHub repo.
- Move the repo to my local machine.
- Commit, push and pull my project.
- Set up a boilerplate template, including establishing language set up and character sets.
- Use italics, bold, ordered and unordered lists.
- Use absolute and relative links.
- Embed images into the site.
