        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It doesn't have to be XFC, takeaway can be all sorts of disgusting, guilt-inducing, slippery food. It can also be good food, but that's not what we look for in takeaway, is it?</p>
        <p>This recipe takes very little time and effort but might lead to gentle, arhythmic heart palpitatons, shallow and rough breathing, and the lingering smell of fried despair.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lethargy</li>
            <li>Empty cupboards</li>
            <li>Some throwaway cash</li>
            <li>Encouragement to <em>"Go on, treat yourself!"</em></li>
            <li>Unused sauce packets from previous takeaways</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Log into <a href='https://www.just-eat.co.uk/' target='_blank'>JustEat</a>, trying not to pay too much attention to the feasts you've recently ordered from that Chinese place run by Sri Lankans.</a></li>

            <li>Exchange awkward pleasantries with the delivery guy.</li>
            <li>Present whatever food you bought on a fancy plate to make it feel like home cooking.</li>

            <li>Keep eating.</li>
            <li>Lean back and try not to move too much for an indefinite period of time.</li>
        </ol>
