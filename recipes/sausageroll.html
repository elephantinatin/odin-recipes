        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gregg invented this pastry a few years ago, I think we all remember it well. Well now we're going to learn how to get our hands on one for ourselves.</p>
        <p>It's <em>crispy</em>. It's <em>pastry</em>. It's <em>hot</em>. Sometimes it's pretty <em>cold</em>. But one thing's for sure, it'll leave crumbs on your shirt.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-6 paper bags</li>
            <li>1-6 sausage rolls</li>
            <li>anything that catches your fancy, you fat fuck</li>
        </ul>
