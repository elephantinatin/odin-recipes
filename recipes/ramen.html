        <h2>Description</h2>
        This recipe was made by my mother, a true artisan in the kitchen. She used to serve it to us in weird plates that turned up at the sides, creating a concave surface.
        <p>Suitable for any dormitory-dwelling dude &lpar;or dudette&rpar; who is determined to do diddly-squat in order to dine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 packet of 23p ramen noodles</li>
            <li>1 little powder packet that comes with it</li>
            <li>1 oil pouch thing that sometimes pops out unexpectedly</li>
            <li>1 cup tap water</li>
            <li>&lsqb;optional&rsqb; your choice of vegetables</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Buy 23p ramen noodles from your local newsagents.</li>
            <li>Go home and open the packet. Pour the contents into a deep plate.</li>
            <li>Before the previous step, put tap water in the kettle and make it boil.</li>
            <li>Eat a few crumbles of the dry ramen.</li>
            <li>Empty some of the hot water into the half-spherical plate containing dry ramen.</li>
            <li>Wait.</li>    
            <li>Stop waiting. Empty the sachets of powder and, if you're lucky, the oil into the wet ramen.</li>
            <li>Use any protruding utensil or digit to stir the ramen.</li>
            <li>Add more stuff if you want.</li>
            <li>Serve it in the large cup plate you had already put it in.</li>
        </ol>
